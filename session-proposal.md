**What will your session or activity allow people to make, learn or do?**

Attendees to this session will learn about privacy on the internet by collaboratively working on new ways of raising awareness about how personal data is shared online

The standard data policies among the main internet companies allow personal user data to be collected, aggregated in user profiles, and frequently used for profiling and predicting user behavior. The pervasive instrumentalization of data collection has important implications ranging from privacy and safety concerns, to the invariability of extreme content personalization.  

Despite some notable initiatives, the devices, apps and browsers that we use everyday are still largely insufficient at telling us what we share, with whom we are sharing it, and how that information is being stored and used. In this session we will collectively imagine, debate and outline possible alternatives to web interfaces that give users more information about - and allow them to retain control over - what they share online.

**How do you see that working?**

We will run a mini-hackathon where people from different backgrounds work in small groups to create privacy-aware web interfaces. Some of the projects that groups will be encouraged to pursue during this session include, but are not limited to, browser extensions, re-imagined web browsing interfaces, and new ways of presenting privacy policies. 

The session will have a twofold structure. There will be an introduction where participants will be given an presentation of the main objectives for the session, as well as presented with three case studies regarding data collection, and three possible alternatives. After that, weâ€™ll brainstorm about possible projects, and participants will team up in different groups related to their interests and the project they want to work on. At the end everyone will share their privacy-aware project and the major questions it raises with the group, and we will create a document with the ideas discussed. 


**How will you deal with varying numbers of participants in your session?**

If there are 5-10 participants, we will do an interactive discussion with all participants in a single group. If there are more participants, we will break out into multiple groups of 3-5 people. 

**What do you see as outcomes after the festival? How will you and your participants take the learning and activities forward?**

As an engineer, I believe it is crucial we become more aware of the political and social implications of the software we design and implement, given that structural regulations that actually protect the our data privacy are limited.

My hope is to create an opportunity to bring together a community of like-minded individuals who will continue to work together in the issues of internet privacy and who will feel better informed and supported to work in applications that address these issues. I also hope that the projects that come out of this session will be implemented and disseminated in ways that help to raise awareness about internet policies and contribute to the discussions around this topic.

I will share with everyone a public document that we will edit collaboratively, and I will create a mailing list where the conversation and the work started at the festival can continue taking place after Mozfest.
