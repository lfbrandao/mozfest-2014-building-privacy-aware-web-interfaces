Building privacy-aware web interfaces
=======

###Privacy hackathon at the Mozilla Festival 2014

**Saturday, October 25th :: 10am-1pm**

https://festival.etherpad.mozilla.org/-kx-8AKg-1S

## Welcome!

In this session you will learn about internet privacy by collaboratively creating new ways of raising awareness about how personal data is shared and aggregated online.

We will run an hackathon where people from different backgrounds work in small groups to create privacy-aware web interfaces. Some of the projects that groups will be encouraged to pursue during this session include, but are not limited to, browser extensions, re-imagined web browsing interfaces, and new ways of presenting and creating privacy policies.

The session will have a three-fold structure. Participants will be given an introduction to the main objectives for the session; they will be presented with case studies regarding data collection; and, most importantly, collaborate in small teams to imagine and implement possible alternatives that make more explict the ways in which personal data is collected, aggregated and shared online. 

At the end of the session, everyone will present their privacy-aware project and the major questions it raises with the group, followed by a short discussion. A document with the ideas discussed will be created and shared with the participants afterwards, so that the discussions and projects began in this hackaton may continue during and after MozFest.

  https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/lightbeam/

##### Project ideas

* Create browser extensions that show what data is being shared. 
* Create JavaScript libraries to help developers easily tell what data you are sharing when you use their websites
* If you could design a browser from scracth, with privacy in mind, what would you change? Are there ways increase the visibility and usability of some of the existing projects discussed above?

#### Theme 3 :: User Profiling

Show how the data collected can be used to create personal user profiles.

##### Examples

* Lightbeam is a Firefox add-on that uses interactive visualizations to show you the first and third party sites you interact with on the Web

##### Ideas

* A browser extension with an icon that is always visible on the browser toolbar and changes it's appearance as you're being tracked
* A browser extension that gives you a daily digest of the websites you visited, information collected by trackers, etc
* An hardware device that sits between you and your router, logs all your traffic and sends you information on how you're being tracked 
* A game where you're prompted to visit multiple websites until enough data is collected to create an accurate profile of you
